<h1>The Best Movies According to Hector</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

  <hr />

    <h3>The Passion of the Christ</h3>
        <p>Amazing photgraphy and really heartfelt. Jim Caviezel does a great job here as Jesus.<br />
            However, what really makes the difference here is that all dialogues in the movie<br />
            are spoken in either aramaic or latin.</p>
    <h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
        <p>I don't know what else can be spoken about a trilogy which obtained almost 20 Oscars and that,<br />
            to this day, still influences the pop culture.<br />
            Peter Jackson performed a job that few in the world would be able to do.</p>
    <h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
        <p>The romantic way they portrayed the way of living of the samurai, their philosophy<br />
            and their bushido, takes my breath away. It is a movie I must watch at least once a year<br />
            or whenever it is on a channel when I'm zapping through.</p>
